Random Number Primality Test

This project showcases the implementation of two distinct algorithms for generating pseudo-random numbers: the Linear Congruential Generator and the Multiply-with-Carry.
After generating the pseudo-random numbers, complementary primality tests are conducted using two algorithms: the Miller-Rabin Primality Test and the Fermat Primality Test.
